# Sports and resistance: How Ukrainian icons are taking up arms to defend their country

Sport’s wry takedown as ‘War Minus shooting’ alludes to the jingoism often associated with supporting partisan teams. But Ukraine’s proud sports legends, washed-out yesteryear stars and young athletes, find themselves embroiled in a desperate war-plus-shooting scenario where they feel duty-bound to pick up arms after the Russian invasion of their country.

**Klitschko brothers**

Multiple World heavyweight title holder Vitali Klitschko, now Mayor of the Ukrainian capital Kiev, told British breakfast show Good Morning Britain on March 25 that: “I don’t have another choice, I have to do that. I’ll be fighting.” The 50-year-old who won super heavyweight gold at the World Military Games in 1995, has been an iconic face of defiance. Russia has dragged the son of a former Soviet major general, and later-day well-living icon, away from his Bentleys and BMWs right into pitched battles defending Kiev.
